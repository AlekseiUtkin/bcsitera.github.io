### Advanced use of Fields

Type:
* Approved Price – then the on the item rows you need to specify campaign prices and predicted quantities. Approved price has the priority and item card line discounts are not counted.
* Open Price- prices are for statistics. You do not need to set up prices for that because they are coming from item price list on the sales order. 
Status:
* Created- new campaign is by default with value Created.
* Confirmed- You can confirm line by line or whole campaign at a time. 
* Partly Approved- Until you haven’t approved whole campaign rows, the status will stay partly approved for example some rows have status refused.
* Refused- Needed for statistics. You can refuse campaign at time or line by line. With approved price campaign then refused lines won’t appear.

### Automatic system controls

Item will not be repeated in the multiple campaigns. If accepting the campaign, the program will control if the Item is already represented in another campaign in this period for the Customer. If Yes, the system alerts user and user must erase the row in the campaign or choose item status refused.
Status change turning the campaign. If the campaign is already started (Date of sale is bigger or the same with today’s date), then user can’t change rows status to approved. Can change only to refused. If the campaign is already started and user need to change the price click on button Edit Campaign Price.  
Date of sale- can’t be later than start and end date. Start date can’t be later than end date. 
NB!
Item rows prices are calculated based on Date of sales date. Campaign prices on rows are calculated 2 decimal places.  
Coping rows from Excel. User needs rows in order: Item No, Prediction, Campaign Price. Copy these 3 rows and all other rows will be filled automatically. 
If you change row information for example the price user sees new Modified by name and date/time. If user add comment into the row, then the Modified by name and date/time will not change.
