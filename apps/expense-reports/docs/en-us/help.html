<p>Expense Reports solution in BC enables the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Management of expense and travel reports</li>
<li>Management of expense documents</li>
<li>Digital archive of expense documents</li>
<li>Connection to digitization partner <a href="https://costpocket.com/en" target="_blank">CostPocket.com</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>To use the solution, <strong>Expense Reports Setup</strong> must be opened and following fields filled:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Explanation</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Expense Document Nos.</td>
<td>For defining Expense document number series. Value can be chosen from <strong>No. Series List</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Expense Report Nos.</td>
<td>For defining Expense report number series. Value can be chosen from <strong>No. Series List</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vendor Registration No. Field</td>
<td>Solution uses vendor registration number for automatic detection of Vendor. Since different country localisations use different fields for storing this data, we have made this value selectable by User. <strong>This selection is recommended but NOT mandatory</strong>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>All expense documents are posted via journal and User can <strong>select a Journal Template and Batch</strong> for this.</p>
<p>To use digitization partner <strong>CostPocket</strong> functionality, action <strong>Registration</strong> must be used for one time. User information in CostPocket registration form page is used to determine Primary user, who shall receive e-mail from CostPocket along with instructions how to use CostPocket app. After successful registration connection with CostPocket is established.</p>
<p>For pretermined cost types User can setup default cost accounts. That can be done in <strong>Cost Types</strong> page. Now when expense documents are imported from CostPocket, system assigns a default G/L cost account determined by document's cost type.</p>
<p>Solution is ment to be used with logic:<br>
User operates daily/weekly in CostPocket app, taking pictures of expense documents and adding them to an Expense report. Bookkeeper operates in BC, getting expense reports with connected expense documents from CostPocket.<br>
<em>For special cases where Expense reports are not used, User can mark <strong>Allow Documents without Report</strong>, which makes individual document posting possible.</em></p>
<h2 id="use">Use</h2>
<h3 id="expense-reports-1">Expense Reports</h3>
<p><strong>Manual creation</strong> of an expense report is usually done after manual creation of expense documents. User can add documents to report with action <strong>Add documents to Report</strong>.</p>
<p>Expense reports <em>(with status Report ready)</em> will be imported from CostPocket, when user presses button <strong>Get Reports from CostPocket</strong>.  Among with an expense report all expense documents, that are connected to this report, shall also be  imported to BC.<br>
On Expense report card User can see total sum of expense documents in LCY.<br>
User can edit submitter information by selecting value from Employees table to <strong>Submitter No.</strong> field. When selecting new value system asks if documents (report lines) should also be updated.<br>
User must set posting date for report and all connected expense documents by entering value to field <strong>Posting Date</strong>.<br>
User can open list of connected expense documents when clicking on <strong>Number of Documents</strong> field value.<br>
To <strong>Post</strong> an expense report means that all connected expense documents are posted. <em>Documents are posted individually.</em></p>
<p>Posted expense reports can be found in <strong>Posted Expense Reports</strong> archive.</p>
<h3 id="expense-documents">Expense Documents</h3>
<p>Manual creation of expense document is possible and is similar to regular purchase invoice.</p>
<p><strong>Vendor and Submitter must be used</strong>.  When getting documents from CostPocket system looks for vendor registration no. in order to find Vendor from Vendors. Similarly submitter e-mail is used to look for Employee with matching company Email from Employees.<br>
User can make multiple document lines with different posting groups (to manage VAT).<br>
<strong>Dimensions</strong> are applied for header only.<br>
Only .jpg type attachments can be uploaded.
Expense document's <strong>Billing Type</strong> can be Personal or Company, depending on finances used.<br>
Currency exchange rate can be adjusted by <strong>Currency Factor</strong> field.<br>
User can work with documents on document card or in expense documents list <em>(mainly to assign Vendor/Submitter/Expense account)</em>.<br>
When an expense account is assigned to document header, User shall be prompted, if document lines should also be updated.<br>
User can check posting with action <strong>Post Preview</strong>.<br>
Solution will make posting entries to both Vendor ledger entries and Employee ledger entries <em>(when Submitter has paid for expense document using personal finances).</em></p>
<p>Documents are usually posted from Expense Report. <em>In special case, when Allow documents without reports selection is used, expense documents can be imported separately with action <strong>Get Documents from CostPocket</strong> and then a document can also be posted from Expense Document list/card.</em></p>
<p>Posted expense documents can be found in <strong>Posted Expense Documents</strong> archive.</p>
